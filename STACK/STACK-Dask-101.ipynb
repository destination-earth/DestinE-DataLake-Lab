    "## What is [Dask](\"https://www.dask.org/\")?\n",
    "Dask is a Python library for parallel and distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask addresses the challenge of scaling Python code from a single machine to large clusters of machines. In the world of data science and scientific computing, Python is a popular language due to its ease of use and extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. However, these libraries often struggle to handle large datasets that exceed the memory capacity of a single machine or require parallel processing for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask provides parallel computing capabilities and allows Python developers to work with larger-than-memory datasets by parallelizing computation across multiple cores within a single machine or distributing it across a cluster of machines. It achieves this by providing parallelized versions of familiar data structures like arrays, dataframes, and lists, which seamlessly integrate with existing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask can run on your laptop or can be scaled out to full capacity to a cloud cluster or HPC system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It offeres a rich ecosystem of Python libraries to support use cases in multiple domains such as:\n",
    "* Geospatial\n",
    "* Finance\n",
    "* Astrophysics\n",
    "* Microbiology\n",
    "* Environmental science\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the Dask [use cases](https://stories.dask.org/en/latest/) page that provides a number of sample workflows to see how others are using Dask to solve their problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Escpecially the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/index.html) community, a community of people working to enable big data geoscience, heavily relies on Dask as the core compute frameworks to be used. Why? Pangeo community early realised the need for scaleable software and tools to handle petabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud platforms.\n",

    "The `futures` interface (derived from the built-in `concurrent.futures`) provide fine-grained real-time execution for custom situations. We can submit individual functions for evaluation with one set of inputs, or evaluated over a sequence of inputs with `submit()` and `map()`. The call returns immediately, giving one or more *futures*, whose status begins as \"pending\" and later becomes \"finished\". There is no blocking of the local Python session.\n",
