         "description": "The CAMS solar radiation services provide historical values (2004 to present) of global (GHI), direct (BHI) and diffuse (DHI) solar irradiation, as well as direct normal irradiation (BNI). The aim is to fulfil the needs of European and national policy development and the requirements of both commercial and public downstream services, e.g. for planning, monitoring, efficiency improvements and the integration of solar energy systems into energy supply grids.\nFor clear-sky conditions, an irradiation time series is provided for any location in the world using information on aerosol, ozone and water vapour from the CAMS global forecasting system. Other properties, such as ground albedo and ground elevation, are also taken into account. Similar time series are available for cloudy (or \"all sky\") conditions but, since the high-resolution cloud information is directly inferred from satellite observations, these are currently only available inside the field-of-view of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, which is roughly Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and the Middle East.\nData is offered in both ASCII and netCDF format. Additionally, an ASCII \"expert mode\" format can be selected which contains in addition to the irradiation, all the input data used in their calculation (aerosol optical properties, water vapour concentration, etc). This additional information is only meaningful in the time frame at which the calculation is performed and so is only available at 1-minute time steps in universal time (UT).",

         "description": "This dataset provides observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)\namounts obtained from observations collected by several current and historical \nsatellite instruments. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite \ninstruments. Typically, different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically depends on the application.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns.  The XCO2 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and OCO-2. The mid-tropospheric CO2 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments on-board the Metop satellite series and from AIRS. \nThe XCO2 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: BESD and WFMD algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP and SRFP algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCO2 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. \nThe IASI and AIRS products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY and AIRS L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)",

For this dataset, methane abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite instruments.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CH4, denoted XCH4 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CH4 columns. \nThe XCH4 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT. The mid-tropospheric CH4 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments onboard the Metop satellite series. The XCH4 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: WFMD and IMAP algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP, OCPR, SRFP and SRPR algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCH4 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. The IASI products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric methane (XCH4), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric methane (CH4)",

         "description": "The Sentinel-2 mission is a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions. The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 10 days with one satellite and 5 days with 2 satellites, making the data of great use in on-going studies. The satellites are equipped with the state-of-the-art MSI (Multispectral Imager) instrument, that offers high-resolution optical imagery. Products are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size, within a single orbit. A granule is the minimum indivisible partition of a product (containing all possible spectral bands).\nFor Level-1C and Level-2A, the granules, also called tiles, are 100x100km2 ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection. The UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) system divides the Earth's surface into 60 zones. Each UTM zone has a vertical width of 6° of longitude and horizontal width of 8° of latitude. (see Figure 1). Tiles are approximately 600 MB in size. Tiles can be fully or partially covered by image data. Partially covered tiles correspond to those at the edge of the swath. Level-2A: Surface reflectances in cartographic geometry. This product is considered as the mission Analysis Ready Data (ARD), the product that can be used directly in downstream applications without the need for further processing. The Level-2A product contains: Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance orthoimage, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, Water Vapour (WV) map, Scene Classification map and Quality Indicators data.",

         "description": "The Low and Mid-Trophic Levels (LMTL) reanalysis for global ocean is produced at [CLS](https://www.cls.fr) on behalf of Global Ocean Marine Forecasting Center. It provides 2D fields of biomass content of zooplankton and six functional groups of micronekton. It uses the LMTL component of SEAPODYM dynamical population model (http://www.seapodym.eu). No data assimilation has been done. This product also contains forcing data: net primary production, euphotic depth, depth of each pelagic layers zooplankton and micronekton inhabit, average temperature and currents over pelagic layers.\n\n**Forcings sources:**\n* Ocean currents and temperature (CMEMS multiyear product)\n* Net Primary Production computed from chlorophyll a, Sea Surface Temperature and Photosynthetically Active Radiation observations (chlorophyll from CMEMS multiyear product, SST from NOAA NCEI AVHRR-only Reynolds, PAR from INTERIM) and relaxed by model outputs at high latitudes (CMEMS biogeochemistry multiyear product)\n\n**Vertical coverage:**\n* Epipelagic layer \n* Upper mesopelagic layer\n* Lower mesopelagic layer (max. 1000m)\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00020\n\n**References:**\n\n* Lehodey P., Murtugudde R., Senina I.

The method is applied to each Argo float equipped with an oxygen sensor using as input the properties measured by the float (pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen), and its date and position.\n\n**Product Citation:** Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products: http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00048\n\n**References:**\n\n* Sauzede R., H.

The product is obtained from an ensemble-based forward feed neural network approach mapping situ data for surface ocean fugacity (SOCAT data base, Bakker et al.  2016, https://www.socat.info/) and sea surface salinity, temperature, sea surface height, chlorophyll a, mixed layer depth and atmospheric CO2 mole fraction. Sea-air flux fields are computed from the air-sea gradient of pCO2 and the dependence on wind speed of Wanninkhof (2014). Surface ocean pH on total scale, dissolved inorganic carbon, and saturation states are then computed from surface ocean pCO2 and reconstructed surface ocean alkalinity using the CO2sys speciation software.\n\n**Product Citation**: Please refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products: http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169.\n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00047\n\n**References:**\n\n* Chau, T.

The OSI SAF delivers three global sea ice products in operational mode: sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, sea ice type (OSI-401 OSI-402 and OSI-403). These products are delivered daily at 10km resolution in a polar stereographic projection covering the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. It is the Sea Ice operational nominal product for the Global Ocean. In addition, a sea ice drift product is delivered at 60km resolution in a polar stereographic projection covering the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The ESA SST CCI and C3S level 4 analyses were produced by running the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system (Good et al., 2020) to provide a high resolution (1/20deg. - approx. 5km grid resolution) daily analysis of the daily average sea surface temperature (SST) at 20 cm depth for the global ocean. Only (A)ATSR, SLSTR and AVHRR satellite data processed by the ESA SST CCI and C3S projects were used, giving a stable product. It also uses reprocessed sea-ice concentration data from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF (OSI-450 and OSI-430; Lavergne et al., 2019).\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00169\n\n**References:**\n\n* Good, S., Fiedler, E., Mao, C., Martin, M.J., Maycock, A., Reid, R., Roberts-Jones, J., Searle, T., Waters, J., While, J., Worsfold, M.
